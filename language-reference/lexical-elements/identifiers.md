# Identifiers

Identifiers are sequences of characters used for naming variables, functions, new data types, and preprocessor macros. You can include letters, decimal digits, and the underscore character `_` in identifiers.

The first character of an identifier cannot be a digit.

Lowercase letters and uppercase letters are distinct, such that foo and FOO are two different identifiers.
