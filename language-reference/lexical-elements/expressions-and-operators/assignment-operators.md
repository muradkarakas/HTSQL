# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators store values in variables. Sodium provides several variations of assignment operators

The standard assignment operator `=` simply stores the value of its right operand in the variable specified by its left operand. As with all assignment operators, the left operand \(commonly referred to as the `lvalue`\) cannot be a literal or constant value.

`int x = 10;` 

`int z = 2 * (3 + function());`
