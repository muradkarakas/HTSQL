# Data Block: Grid View Mode

If data block's [record-count property](https://muradkarakas.github.io/Sodium-Manual/datablock_record_count.html) is greater than 1, you get the grid view.

In grid view mode you will show more than one row on the screen and each of them matches a row in database table/views.
