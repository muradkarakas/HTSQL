Sodium has 2 basic types of components in order to achieve its functionality: FRMX and SQLX files. The former \(form file\) is actually an html file with special tags/attributes and the latter is Code Behind File.

* [Form File](form-file.md)
* [Code Behind File](code-behind-file.md)
* [Controller File](controller-file.md)
