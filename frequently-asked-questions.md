# Frequently Asked Questions

##  **Is Sodium open-source ?** <a id="is-sodium-open-source"></a>

Currently, no.

##  **What is Domain-Specific Language \(DSL\):** <a id="what-is-domain-specific-language-dsl"></a>

A domain-specific language \(DSL\) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language \(GPL\), which is broadly applicable across domains.

**Will Sodium support different Operation Systems other than Microsoft Windows ?**

It must run on other systems too. However, I need support for that.

**Will you create a converter application from Oracle Forms to Sodium ?**

It is not an easy task and Sodium is not mature enough for that at the moment. Therefore, I am currently focused on development of Sodium. Without Sodium, converter application is useless. However, if someone decide to write a converter application \(which is easer than Sodium\), I'll move my focus to this objective since **lots of people/client I know are waiting for that.**

**Sodium currently supports Oracle and PostgreSQL databases. What is next ?**
