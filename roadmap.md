# Roadmap

## Roadmap

* MySql support
* MS Sql Server support
* Adding Https support
* Adding Server Sent Events \(SSEs\) support

## Things To Do

* IDE should be informed through debugger if syntax error is occured during sqlx/frmx file parsing process
* Datablocks must have "key-column-name". If this attributes not exists, datablock will work with database native row identifier \(if exists\)
